# ðŸ§  Data Science Project

Welcome to my **Data Science Project** repository!  
This is a personal space where I document my journey into the world of Machine Learning and Data Science.  
I'll be working on a variety of projects over the coming weeks and beyond, whenever time allows.

[List of projects](https://github.com/utsusemi82/DataScienceProject/blob/528b0a71be09405fab95b6cb071ce48a79e28e3a/ProjectList.md)

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A **portfolio** of projects I've completed
- A **learning log** for techniques and tools I've revised
- A **roadmap** of upcoming projects I'm excited to tackle (perhaps)
