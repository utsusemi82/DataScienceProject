## Telecom Churn Prediction

**Churn prediction** is a critical challenge in the *telecom* industry. Accurately identifying customers likely to leave can help companies implement retention strategies. 

In this project, I use a real-world telecom dataset to build a Machine Learning model that predicts customer churn. I will also try to deploy a simple Streamlit app.
