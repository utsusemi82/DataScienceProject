# ðŸš¢ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is based on the classic [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), where the objective is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Kaggle Submission (Accuracy)
- *Score:* `0.77511`

---

##  What I Plan to Learn Next 
- More advanced feature selection techniques
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
- Understanding model evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score)
- Model explainability using SHAP or LIME
- Trying ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost

This was a great beginner-friendly competition to apply basic machine learning techniques and practice a full DS/ML pipeline.
