## Telecom Churn Prediction

**Churn prediction** is a critical challenge in the *telecom* industry. Accurately identifying customers likely to leave can help companies implement retention strategies. 

In this project, I will use a real-world telecom dataset to build a Machine Learning model that predicts customer churn and deploy a simple Streamlit app and create DV dashboard using PowerBI/Tableau if possible.

I will try a lot of *ML supervised classification techniques* for learning and testing purposes for my revision:
| Random Forest| An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, improving prediction accuracy|
| Logistic Regression | A statistical method that predicts the probability of an event occurring. |
| Support Vector Machines (SVM) | Find a hyperplane that optimally separates different classes.|
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | Classifies a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbours in the feature space.|
| Neural Networks | Mimic the structure of the human brain, learning complex patterns through interconnected nodes.|
| Decision Trees | Represent decisions and their possible outcomes, with each internal node testing an attribute, and each leaf node representing a class label. |
| Gradient Boosting | A powerful ensemble ML algorithm that combines multiple weak models (often decision trees) to create a strong predictive model |
| XGBoost | An open-source ML library that implements gradient boosting algorithms, particularly for tasks like regression, classification, and ranking. |
